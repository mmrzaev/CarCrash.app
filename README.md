ðŸš€ Hello there!
Today, I'm working on a game in Unity. The core idea is to navigate obstacles and cross roads without damaging the vehicle. Over the next few days, Iâ€™ll be implementing procedural map generation and vehicle destructibility, which should add more depth and challenge to the gameplay.

Most likely, the game will be designed for mobile platforms, focusing on smooth controls and an engaging experience. Iâ€™m also exploring different mechanics to make the gameplay more dynamic and fun!

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss game development! ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¥
